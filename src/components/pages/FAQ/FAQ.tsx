            question: "I can't code, can I join?",
            answer: "Yes! If you're new to programming, a hackathon is the best place for you to go to. There'll be plenty of mentors ready to assist you with whatever problem you face. Don't hestitate to ask for help, we don't bite!"

            question: "What do I bring?",

            question: "Do I need a hotel?",       
            answer: "You can sleep over if you'd like. You'll probably want to bring a sleeping bag and some spare clothes. Unfortunately, we don't have showers."
